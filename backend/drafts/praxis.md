# Praxis Nation

Praxis, a for-profit company founded in 2019 (then as Bluebook Cities), seeks to purchase territory and create a new city, 'Praxis Nation', 'a home for the brave, who strive for virtue and wisdom'. Praxis Nation claims the title for 'The First Network State'. The expanded definition for a Network State, according to its philosophical father Balaji Srinivasan is as follows:

> A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.

Let's use these concepts to review what Praxis is up to.

- a moral innovation, 

What's the theory that Praxis intends to put into practice? The shortest version I've heard is "a more vital way of life". What does this mean? As stated on their website, they express (part of) their mission as such: 

“Inspired by the wisdom of great civilizations, we believe that true sovereignty is achieved through alignment with the transcendent. The Praxian way of life is driven by a vital energy that seeks transcendence through heroic action and contemplation. Our mission is to channel this drive into a cohesive way of life, forged by social structures and institutions that guide our people toward their destiny.” 

How they intend to connect to the transcendent is unclear, as there does not seem to be any direct suggestion to adopt (an organised) religion. To put this vision in simpler language, Praxis' founder Dryden Brown (to whom we'll return) provides a convenient diagram in an older blogpost:

from: blabla

To summarise their moral innovation, is to build a city that specifically recruits those who have 

- a sense of national consciousness

If you manage to attract people who recognise themselves in the heroic mission, and can foster an environment for them that encourages the arts and enables the sciences, as well as have plenty of gyms around, then Praxians may increasingly think of themselves as Praxians, as opposed to expatriates who show up for some reason or another. 


There is enough reason to believe that its founders take this sense of identity rather seriously, as can be read from its tribute to the numinous in its mission down to the quality of the physical cards you get sent if you become a (proto-)citizen.

- A recognised founder

Dryden Brown grew up surfing in California, and ended up working for a hedge fund in New York called Pershing Square, that, among other things, invested in Howard Hughes Holdings, which had already built various cities around the US, 

The Woodlands, Texas; Columbia, Maryland; and Summerlin, Nevada — each with over 100,000 residents.

At Pershin Square, he met his cofounder Charlie Callinan, with whom in 2019 he founded Bluebook Cities, and went to Africa to study the development of cities. This was in some part funded by a grant from Emergent Ventures.


He then traveled to Nigeria and Ghana, where he met with Ghana's vice president and proposed building a financial center

This had mixed results, 

Afterwards, he returned to NY where he was stuck in his apartment due to COVID, and had the realisation that you could 

start the network before the state

then what?

It mostly comes down to him being young, inexperienced, and a bit in over his head, as well as interested in thinkers not condoned by the NYT. So far so good! Read his response [here](https://x.com/drydenwtbrown/status/1846635894650044562). We at based.guide are agnostic, and frankly indifferent to the topic of Brown's character, and will simply keep you up to date on the progress made. According to his X-thread, the NYT character assassination was 

Another person important is Charlie Callinan

You'd be excused if, reading the report up to this point, you've the impression that this all seems a bit nutty. But there are reasons to be optimistic, most notably in terms of whom Praxis has been able to attract. 

First of all, associated with the project, as Vice Chairman, is David Weinreb, the former CEO of Howard Hughes Holdings. Weinreb has serious experience building actual cities from nothing, and presumably took a liking to Brown and was willing to associate with the project. 

- A capacity for collective action

Praxis self-reports on over 14,000 members, including skilled individuals from various fields. And they claim to have

What is most impressive, is that the allegedly young, inexperienced, and uncharismatic Brown has, in addition to getting serious people on board, managed to find and receive investment from just about every major figure in the space. And quite a lot, too.

- An in-person level of civility

There's been some marriages that have come out of the community (NW state talk claims this)

- An integrated cryptocurrency

The investment deal hinges on this

- A consensual government limited by a social smart contract

In the crypto vision:

- An archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories,

The community is currently in the last stages of deciding on a location for their new city, which is expected to have 1000 acres and about 10,000 people. The initial location should be in the Latin America or Mediterranean regions. The city is planned to be finalized in Q1 2025.

What does it need that money for?
- Buying land
- Getting permits
- Tokenizing the land
- Constructing stuff
- Getting people to move

- A virtual capital

The discord?

- An on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint

There is no such thing yet but with the launch of the currency, maybe

### How to get involved?

You can become a Praxis Nomad by going to through their join page's form: https://www.praxisnation.com/join, and expressing interest. Many people have applied to become Citizen, and to obtain a Steel Visa, such that many had to be waitlisted. Becoming a Praxis Nomad is now a way to show your interest for those not immediately whitelisted to become citizens, and to perhaps get accepte later, as you are prompted to answer a few questions to figure out how you'll be an asset to Praxis' ambitions. More info on the Nomad program [here](https://www.praxisnation.com/news/nomad-announcement)

### How will it be governed?

Unclear, also how it would make money is unclear?
