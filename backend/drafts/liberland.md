## What is it?

The official, albeit self-proclaimed title of Liberland, is the ‘Free Republic of Liberland'. It is a [micronation](/projects/glossary#micronation) located on a small piece of disputed territory between Croatia and Serbia - founded on [libertarian](/projects/glossary#libertarianism) principles by Czech right-libertarian politician and activist Vít Jedlička. It is part of a larger and growing libertarian movement which aims to create a sovereign state that champions individual liberty, voluntary association, and minimal government intervention.

Its specific location is along the western bank of the Danube River and occupies an area of approximately 7 square kilometers (2.7 square miles). This small size is not unprecedented in the realm of microstates. For instance, the Vatican City occupies a mere 0.44 square kilometers and is recognised as a fully functioning sovereign state.

In accordance with libertarian principles, Liberland's governance model is formulated on the idea of a minimal government, with a focus on personal and economic freedoms. Its motto is, "To live and let live", 
encapsulates its core philosophy of non-interference and respect for individual rights. 

While Liberland has many aspirations for full autonomy and statehood, it's important to note that it is currently not classified as a [microstate](/projects/glossary#microstate), but rather a micronation. This is because microstates tend to have recognition from other nation states in the international community. This key distinction is somewhat subjective, but still remains a useful way to demarcate micronation projects from microstate projects.

## History

Liberland initially began from the mind of Czech libertarian activist [Vít Jedlička](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADt_Jedli%C4%8Dka) on April 13, 2015. It was a response to, and a seized opportunity from, the ongoing border dispute between Croatia and Serbia which resulted in a small portion of land being left unclaimed by either country.

The full context of this dispute has its origins in the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The Badinter Arbitration Committee, tasked with determining the borders of the new states, used the principle of 'uti possidetis juris', which transformed the former internal Yugoslav borders into international ones. 'Uti possidetis juris' states that any newly created sovereign state should keep their internal borders that their prior dependent area had before their independence. Regardless, this decision created issues along the Danube River, due to its shifting borders from natural processes and human interventions.
The consequence of this was that some historically Croatian territories ended up being placed on the Serbian side of the Danube, while smaller portions of the formerly Serbian territory remained on the Croatian side. Neither Serbia or Croatia were satisfied with this new territorial situation and thus, the beginning of the ongoing dispute began and continues to this day. It was exactly this ambiguity which Jedlička seized upon and allowed him to claim the land as terra nullius (no man's land) and create Liberland. The date of Liberland's proclamation was deliberately chosen to coincide with Thomas Jefferson's birthday, reflecting the founder’s' admiration for classical liberal values.

In the days following its declaration, Liberland quickly gained international attention. Thousands of people registered for citizenship online, attracted by the promise of a minimal government and a free-market economy. However, the fledgling nation faced immediate challenges from neighboring countries, particularly Croatia. Croatian authorities have consistently prevented access to the land, arguing that under international law, new countries cannot be established on disputed territories. This has resulted in several incidents where Jedlička, his supporters and even journalists were arrested while attempting to enter Liberland.

Despite these obstacles, Jedlička and his team have continued to develop Liberland's institutional framework, including drafting a constitution, designing a flag, and creating a national anthem. They have also engaged in diplomatic efforts to gain recognition from established nations; recognition still remains uncertain.

## Why Liberland?

The Liberland founders and its proponents argue that its existence is necessary in today’s world and serves several crucial aims for the continued propagation of freedom, greater political experimentation and a challenge to the current international status quo.
While Liberland does not currently exist officially within the international framework, its striving to become a fully sovereign micro state raises many questions which need to be asked. For instance, conventional ideas about statehood and governance are currently widely accepted by the majority of the world’s population. However, when new nations emerge, it can generate discussions about the meaning, origins and moral status of things like sovereignty, self determination and the roles which individuals and governments have. How can new nations emerge in the current order? What are the mechanisms by which it is allowed? And, is it even feasible politically and economically when most land is already claimed by existing countries?

To answer any of these questions, experimentation and new ideas are needed. With Liberland’s growing popularity, a unique opportunity presents itself - testing libertarian principles in a controlled and national level way. Varying degrees of libertarian and classical liberal projects have been tried and are ongoing, but these attempts to grasp greater freedoms from nation states and their governments are plagued by political uncertainty or lack of autonomy. In contrast, Liberland is shooting for the moon and hopes to experiment fully with a minimalist style state that puts free markets and individual liberties first.

One of the issues Liberland brings to the forefront by its mere existence is the conflict between self-determination in the United Nations Charter and that of territorial integrity which is fundamental to international law. This is a core feature of many contemporary discussions about secession and the formation of new states. One direction Liberland could head towards for gaining recognition is via the Montevideo criteria and then claiming terra nullius and thus  then, claiming it for themselves.
Similar to other libertarian inspired projects, Liberland aims to create an alternative system of governance for those who dislike the status quo arrangements between nation states and individuals. Their vision is for voluntary association and minimal state interference to be the new status quo in their micronation and for individuals to have greater control over their lives and choices. One readily available way Liberland aims to achieve this is through embracing open financial and governance markets with a focus on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. By doing so, individuals can have greater control over their financial choices and governing models which interact with their own lives.

While these possibilities and aims remain promising, Liberland's creation and goals are highly controversial with both Croatia and Serbia. Some academic and political critics argue that recognizing Liberland via its legal arguments may lead to international instability and encourage a wider acceptance for secession and separatist style movements more generally. To be expected, the international community has yet to recognise Liiberland and this reluctance or mere avoidance of the situation, points to either their concerns about maintaining the current order, or purely a lack of need to take it seriously.
While it may be true that there exists a real need for Liberland and its libertarian experimentation, it faces many challenges from the existing international community - both political and legal. Its struggle to gain wider recognition for its territorial and national aims is part of a larger and evolving discussion about self determination, national sovereignty and individual freedoms. This ongoing debate is far from over and will likely never be fully settled, but the current landscape has objective legal and political issues, and Liberland is helping us think about what ought to be and not just what is.

## The Progress

Despite the challenges listed above and others beyond the scope of this article, Liberland has been able to make significant progress in other areas over its 9 years of existence. As of 2024, many of these achievements are primarily on paper or in the digital realm, but its growing popularity and active community points to an exciting future. 

As of March 2024, Liberland has granted 1,200 people citizenship and for around $10,000 given them ‘Liberlandian’ passports. It has also received roughly 735,000 citizenship requests and individuals who can stay in the territory for a week without being evicted get free citizenship. Also, a merit-based system for citizenship has been established, where applicants accumulate ‘merits’' through donations of money or services for Liberland. 5000 merits are needed to acquire citizenship, but E-residency can be purchased for $150.

In regards to governance, a draft constitution has been created and its contents include principles about the scope of the Liberland state and the rights of its citizens. In addition, a provisional government was formed with Liberland’s founder Vit Jedlička as its new president and several others as cabinet members. Moreover, Liberland has its own court system run on blockchain technology and allows citizens and E-residents to start businesses, use insurance reliably, apply the enforcement of smart and traditional contracts and for them to participate in a form of digital direct democracy from anywhere on the planet. Lastly, while Liberland doesn’t have an official currency exactly, it does have a cryptocurrency token called Liberland dollar which is used on its blockchain and can be traded on some crypto exchanges.

In the arena of diplomacy, Liberland has established offices for diplomatic missions in several countries, such as Croatia, Serbia, and the Czech Republic. Moreover, Jedlička has approached and had discussions with several members of the European Parliament and als with members of the Swiss Parliament in particular. Long standing diplomatic missions have been established in numerous countries such as Croatia, France, Serbia, Germany, Hungary, the United Kingdom and the United States.

With online community building, Liberland has also been successful in gaining popularity and online presence in the mainstream and in libertarian communities. Their substantial online following has led to the aforementioned citizenship requests and attention from news outlets such as the New York Times. To continue their community building and social growth both offline and online, there are also regular meetups and conferences across the world.
As is obvious, Liberland’s founder, its current citizens and the growing community takes the idea of Liberland very seriously, even if other political organizations and nation states do it. Regardless of the elusiveness of international recognition, Liberland continues to grow in sophistication and its ongoing experimentation in digital governance can only be a positive thing for other micronations, but also existing nation states too.

## The Future

In summary, while Liberland has made significant progress in developing its internal structures, models of governance, monetary systems, legal implementations and building an online community,  it continues to face arguably the largest hurdle - a physically established and internationally recognized state. The progress made to date remains in the space of ideas and digital initiatives which is far less than it hopes to achieve. Crucial elements of being a true microstate like territorial control and diplomatic recognition remain elusive. 

As it moves forward, Liberland will need to resolve key problems to attain its ambitious goals. While leadership continues to pursue diplomatic channels and leverage international law to strengthen their claims, new strategies need to be attempted to flip the odds of success in their favor. For if any recognition was achieved, it would dramatically accelerate Liberland's development and legitimacy.

In connection to international recognition, physical settlement of the territory is largely prevented via the opposition from Croatia and Serbia which it borders. Liberland's strategy will likely continue to involve negotiations, legal action and argumentation and seeking international  courts to mediate and resolve the dispute.

Economically, Liberland’s growth and prosperity will rely on its ability to attract international investment from wealthy donors and via crowdfunding. They must also promote and attract businesses and make it easy for them to set up digital presences and operations on their blockchain before the territory is able to be used. It is possible that the promise of low taxes and minimal regulations could appeal to libertarian minded entrepreneurs and companies, potentially turning Liberland into a type of special economic zone.

In the future, if the claimed territory is able to be inhabited, it will be Liberland’s responsibility to begin the communities migration from largely online to the physical world. This involves more than just moving individuals to the territory, but also building infrastructure and crucial services for the inhabitants. This is especially important in the early stages of development where there are more risks involved to those making the move.

As global discussions around decentralization, personal freedom, and the role of government evolve, Liberland's experimentation in libertarian nation-building will continue to be a  fascinating example - regardless of whether it ultimately succeeds. Even it’s possible failure will hold the seeds to a different micronation's success.
