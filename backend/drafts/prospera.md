## What is it?

Próspera is an innovative, semi-autonomous city based on the island of Roatan, Honduras. Próspera Inc was founded in 2017 by Erick Brimen, and officially broke ground in 2020. It aims to develop a unique legal, regulatory and governance structure for innovative entrepreneurs, driven individuals and free thinkers within its unique special economic zone. Although not a fully autonomous entity, Próspera is part of Honduras’ [ZEDE](/projects/glossary#zede) (Zone for Economic Development and Employment) legislation - giving Próspera far more autonomy over its own economic and political future. In practice, this means it presently has its own fiscal, regulatory and legal structures, but is still bound by the constitution of Honduras and its criminal code.

Inspired by cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai, Próspera aims to drive progress in directions which are normally not possible under regular governance systems. This project, which is managed by Honduras Próspera Inc, has been privately financed by several key investors such as Peter Thiel, Balaji Srinivasan, Marc Andreessen and more. Fundamentally, Próspera has fashioned itself as a platform which will be able to operate across cities and geographies, instantiating [classical liberal](/projects/glossary/#classic-liberalism) and [libertarian](/projects/glossary#libertarianism) principles.

In Roatan, Honduras, Próspera’s governance structure is made up of nine council members - five being elected and four being appointed by Honduras Próspera Inc. In addition, decisions affecting Próspera must have a two third majority to pass, thus giving Honduras Próspera Inc veto power if all members vote together. It should be noted that while this council drives decision making, it is still below the authority of the Committee of Best Practices, who are unelected members appointed by the government of Honduras itself.

In the future, Próspera aims to build itself into a platform from which other [special economic zones](/projects/glossary#sez) and communities can model themselves after and use as a governance service. 

## History

The origins of Próspera can be found in several key moments and ideas. One of which being Paul Romer, the Nobel prize winning economist, who created the idea of [charter cities](/projects/glossary#charter-city) and met with the then Honduras Presidential Chief of Staff Octavio Sanchez to discuss the ideas. Although not directly part of the project more recently, his ideas were influential in birthing the economic potential of Próspera. In 2013, the ZEDE legislation was initially passed by the Honduras government and was necessary for the emergence of Próspera itself. Although successful in passing, it almost never came to be because the ZEDE initially failed to be passed in 2012. Only after the plans were modified, was it approved by the Supreme court in 2013 under a different set of judges.  

In 2017, Próspera Inc purchased 58 acres of largely jungle land and from this, built several office buildings, a schoolhouse, a factory for prefabricated construction materials and a shared workspace for office workers as of 2021. There are also currently several condominiums in progress or already finished. The pace at which Próspera Inc has been building is generally unheard of in Honduras and has not been subject to the same types of bribery and corruption needed to get projects like this off the ground.

## Why New Roatan, Honduras?

In some ways, Próspera Honduras is a miracle. However, this spectacular achievement would not have been possible without ZEDEs. We will quickly cover what they are and some of the benefits of such legislation and how it enables Próspera to flourish on the island of Roatán. A ZEDE (Zone for Employment and Economic Development) is a geographic subdivision of land which is semi-autonomous, has its own civil code, regulatory frameworks and control over economic legislation. However, it is still subject to the criminal code of the partner government.

In essence, ZEDEs allow for model cities to be built within partner nation states and they operate as independent municipalities which have the ability to build infrastructure, permit the processing of goods and appoint its own technical secretary which is akin to a mayor. Within a ZEDE, disputes can be resolved through specific international courts; businesses and individuals have the ability to opt into the framework put forward by the governing body of the ZEDE.

This is not the only reason why Roatán, Honduras is such a desirable location for Próspera. Located on an island off of mainland Honduras, it has an abundance of natural beauty, views across Pristine Bay from the mountain side and tropical weather with white sand beaches. In the surrounding area, there are many old comunas, fishing boat docks and other tourist attractions for those with a sense of adventure. Amongst all this beauty, the island itself has many natural resources and is located close to major shipping lanes.

For those wishing to migrate to Próspera, it is a good choice for those with English language ability. Most people living on the island speak english and it is a former British colony. To round off this list, it also boasts an impressively low crime rate, relative to mainland Honduras. 

## The Progress

It is without hyperbole to say that Próspera Inc has made huge leaps with its governance as a service in Roatan, Honduras. The operating principle of Próspera rests upon its platform which allows for rights to be sold to land, alternative legal structures adopted by businesses and free market regulations to attract foreign investment and business. These policies and regulations are different from mainland Honduras and national laws are often selected in favor of free market solutions 

One notable example of these differences. is Próspera's land regulation which allows for far more permissive zoning compared to other Latin startup cities. These land holdings can be sold by Próspera Inc, extracting value from these sales to put back into the company and its governance service. One example of this in action, is when the regulatory code allows for the transfer of development rights, giving developers the ability to purchase air and land rights from each other, so as to cooperate on the construction of skyscrapers.

To ensure financial transactions are smooth in all types of purchases, - including the ones above - Próspera has set up its own financial center which can regulate financial transactions in a streamlined way. The consequence being faster transactions, less overhead for companies and an ease for conducting any type of legal business. This novel financial system works in tandem with their alternative legal system based on common law. However, businesses are free to be regulated under any OECD recognised country or propose their own regulation framework to the city’s authorities. In essence, a mix and match approach. To give backbone to this novel system, Próspera has also developed its own arbitration center to handle disputes in a timely manner -  faster than traditional government courts.

The platform most of these frameworks operate within is called E-Próspera. Unlike many special economic zones, this public administration system is used for handling all types of tasks such as: registering digital and physical residency and citizenship, handling individual and business data, determining the status of legal matters and complying with desired regulations. This system is similar to one Estonia has set up and costs a small annual fee.

In the sphere of classical liberal and libertarian ideas, prospective residents may be interested to know that Próspera also boasts relatively low taxes. There is currently, 10% income tax on 50% of gross income, 2.5% retail VST, 10% corporate income tax on 10% of gross income and 1% land value tax.

From such uncertain beginnings, Próspera has taken leaps and bounds in developing a genuinely innovative and radical city. In essence, a country within a country, with a commitment to being as free and liberty minded as possible.. 

## The Future

With the amount of progress having been made already, one wonders what is next for Próspera. While this private city located within Honduras’s ZEDE aims to travel further in its goal of being a haven of freedom, economic stability and prosperity, there are several challenges it must face and several tantalizing opportunities on the horizon.

First and foremost, Próspera must continue to attract dynamic and forward thinking entrepreneurs. This means persuading bright minds to take the leap and set up their business operations in Roatan, Honduras. Industries which are currently being targeted are biotech, cryptocurrency and A.I. Examples of this include Próspera hosting biohacking conferences with speakers such as Bryan Johnson and the mini-city [Vitalia](https://vitalia.city/), being set up as a district within Roatan, Honduras.  Moreover, such services as health and education are currently in the stages of being privatized and financed from the taxes, fees and and sales of land to new residents and investors. 

There are several roadblocks and hurdles which have recently emerged though. In 2022, newly elected socialist President Xiomara Castro began proceedings to repeal the 2013 legislation which enabled ZEDEs. When the legislation was officially repealed, it was deemed unconstitutional even when the two prior Supreme Court rulings were to the contrary. With that being said, ZEDEs were created within a framework that gives a 50 year sunset clause that is bound by international laws. This makes them functionally impossible to repeal. In addition, the regime has recently stated that the repeal will not affect existing ZEDEs, but only prevent the creation of new ones. The official legal status is murky at best.

On the local level, the comuna of Crawfish Rock on Roatán is a portion of land that is inhabited by island natives. To expand further from its 1 square mile footprint, Prospera would need to purchase more land, but it has no intentions to currently do so. This effectively puts a limit on its ability to grow past its geopolitical constraints. In addition, there is a slight sense of unease between locals and new residents. A narrative of gentrification and rising prices has put a target on Próspera’s back - even as Próspera based businesses are the largest provider of jobs for Crawfish Rock Residents.
