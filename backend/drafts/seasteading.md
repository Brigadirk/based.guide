## What is it?

In its most basic form, seasteading embodies the idea of autonomy and new types of political units which can be free from existing nation state authority. However, in practice seasteading has a far more varied approach to how governments can and should interact with seasteading projects. In both cases, seasteading offers a future less influenced by nation state control and more freedom to direct voluntary governance and economic decisions. More than this, seasteading is an opportunity for experimentation in novel forms of governance, economic systems and even sub-cultures.

In addition, seasteading incorporates varied sets of ideas and philosophies which are important to its unique identity. While not all seasteading projects primarily focus on sustainability, many do, and it has become an important cornerstone for the movement. Many projects aim to create seasteads which are not only innovative, but sustainable and self-sufficient too. As mentioned above, seasteading is a diverse movement, and this extends to the locations in which seasteads can and will be constructed. Some projects aim to be outside of territorial waters, while others seek special arrangements within a host country's territory. Architecturally, seasteads are also diverse. They range from repurposed maritime vessels and modified ocean platforms to artificial islands of varying shapes and sizes.

At its core, the seasteading community is a conglomeration of ideas. From libertarians and entrepreneurs, to environmental advocates and those seeking a new form of living - each group being pulled together by the common cause of exploring the possibilities which seasteading provides. Seasteading has never been just an abstract ideal, it is a radical new way of  building societies which can function on the oceanic frontier.

## History

Seasteading has roots dating back to the mid-20th century. Early influences include Japanese Metabolist architects and the European architects William Katavolos, Rudolf Doernach, and Paolo Soleri among others - all of whom focused on the relationship between biological structures, ecology and design. It was also the US Navy's experiments in offshore living which contributed to its early development and paved the way for the practical side of implementing these ideas.

As the concept evolved, engineers grappled with challenges such as structural design problems, ocean conditions, free-floating vs tethered foundations, and modular or monolithic architectures. In the 1960s, Buckminster Fuller proposed a floating tetrahedron city in Tokyo Bay capable of housing 10,000 people. Fuller’s mathematically inspired design consisted of networked units which formed larger structures: three to six neighborhoods would form a town, and three to seven towns would form a city.

In 1975, Elisabeth Mann Borgese, known as the "Mother of the Oceans", predicted in her book ‘The Drama of the Oceans’, that floating cities would be built by the early 21st century and that there were currently no material or engineering problems which prevented their creation. In 1977, the legal expert Kent Keith authored a paper entitled, ‘Floating cities: A new challenge for transnational law’. It explored the legal implications of floating cities and seasteading for transnational law. Moreover, he speculated on the foreign and economic policy of nation-state governments towards such floating city states if they were to be built. 

In more recent times, thinkers such as Wayne Gramlich, Patri Friedman and Joe Quirk have pioneered many of the intellectual, political and practical ideas of seasteading. Starting in the late 90s with Wayne Gramlich’s notably practical article, ‘Homesteading the High Seas’ which had several iterations into the early 2000s and evolving with Friedman’s and Gramlick’s joint paper, ‘Getting Serious About Seasteading’. More recently in 2017, Friedman and Quirk published a book entitled, ‘Seasteading: How Floating Nations Will Restore the Environment, Enrich the Poor, Cure the Sick, and Liberate Humanity from Politicians’. It covered the major benefits and transformational ability which seasteading could have on the world. In 2008, Friedman founded the Seasteading Institute which advocates for a "market of governance" where different societies compete for citizens. Currently, Joe Quirk is the President of the institution. 

Despite technological advancements making seasteads more feasible, political and legal challenges persist, particularly regarding sovereignty issues. Currently, no permanent seastead is recognized as sovereign within international waters. The seasteading movement continues to evolve, embodying human ingenuity and the quest for new frontiers in living and governance. It represents an ongoing exploration of alternative societal structures and the potential for human habitation beyond traditional terrestrial boundaries.

## Why Seasteading?

Seasteading presents a groundbreaking approach to human habitation and governance. On its face, it may seem outlandish or even wasteful. However, this couldn’t be further from reality. In fact, there are numerous benefits which could reshape our relationship with state, terrestrial and oceanic environments and both politics and economic systems in the direction of greater freedoms and voluntaryism. The ocean is a vast expanse of unclaimed territory and seastading aims to use that space to maximize political autonomy, grow new types of social communities and gradually remove the constraints existing nation states have over its citizens.

One of the most compelling and discussed aspects of seasteading is its potential for sustainability. If implemented well, seasteads could harness the accessible energy sources such as solar, wind, and wave power. At the same time, it is possible for communities to utilize aquaculture to produce food. In the future, it may also be possible for such ocean settlements to become completely self-sufficient and thus, also be less impacted by economic downturns and other global events.

Just as the new territories in the Americas were littered with opportunities, the open ocean too presents a vast well of untapped potential. However, it can only be properly utilized with the right social, engineering and architectural knowledge. Just as the lunar landing pushed the boundaries of human ingenuity, seasteads will also require vast amounts of human creativity and willpower to make them a reality. If achieved, advancements in seasteading could lead to breakthroughs which also become applicable to terrestrial communities and countries too. 
In the economic realm, seasteading has the opportunity of pioneering new markets in aquaculture, renewable energy research, engineering and also the vast untapped market of ocean-based tourism. If we peer into the future, we can also imagine these floating cities and communities being able to relocate to different areas of the world, dock in different countries and do trade autonomously. This is but a thin layer of the economic opportunities for grabs. If such seabased entities come to exist, the legal ramifications would also upend many of the constraints terrestrial cities, towns and countries currently have. For example, development in unclaimed or permissible oceanic waters would move at a faster pace, with little existing infrastructure and regulatory policy to slow down projects. 

The vast space available for expansion in the oceans means that sea steading can accommodate growing populations without encroaching on existing land-based communities or ecosystems. Additionally, the abundance of resources such as water, space, and sunlight for energy production ensures the long-term viability of these floating cities.

## The Progress

The progress seasteading has made over the last few decades is notable, but as of yet, no permanent seastead communities have been built to operate either autonomously or semi-autonomously. However, it would be amiss to ignore the progress which has been made. Since its founding in 2008, The Seasteading Institute has made significant strides across a number of notable projects, learning valuable lessons along the way.

One notable example was the Floating City Project in French Polynesia which began its journey in 2013 as part of a crowdfunding campaign. After several design cycles and political negotiations, a 2017 memorandum of understanding was signed with the government and Blue Frontiers was founded to develop the project. Unfortunately, the project ground to a halt and was never completed due to the misinformation being spread by the opposition to President Édouard Fritch.

However, there are also ongoing projects within the Seasteading Institute’s umbrella which are promising and ought to be discussed. SeaBricks is a project that produces a floating system of connected blocks made of seaweed materials. These renewable objects are used to support marine based structures and developments like floating cities and smaller settlements. Specifically, SeaBricks will be used as wave break barriers, power station surfaces and building foundations, but have the ability to support a wide range of ocean constructions without impinging on local ecosystems. In contrast to concrete, SeaBrick will also  sequester carbon, not add to existing greenhouse emissions. 

Based in Florida, Arktide is another ongoing project led by the Seasteading Institute and it aims to create affordable sea-based real estate while participating in the $100M Carbon Removal XPRIZE competition. Their ambitious goal is to remove over a gigaton of carbon from the atmosphere using natural ocean processes while at the same time providing sustainable infrastructure that meets human needs and supports ocean ecosystems. The project is actively working on innovative designs to enhance safety and affordability for individuals and businesses interested in seasteading. Through these efforts, Arktide hopes to synthesize the aims of environmental sustainability and ocean based living with all the political and economic consequences that entails.
Ocean Builders is another project with big aims and an interesting philosophy for achieving them. The company originated in Thailand, continued evolving in Panama and is now focused on expanding into Asian and European markets. On the implementation side, it has created the world's first floating eco-friendly smart home called the "SeaPod." It has an innovative 360° design which focuses on the luxury and smaller scale home markets at this stage of development. The bigger vision is for a larger scale floating architecture, complete with smart home technology. Ocean Builders combines expertise in marine sciences, floating architecture, and ocean technologies to pioneer a new era of aquatic living. Their work marks the start of what they call the "aquatic age," pushing the boundaries of how we can sustainably inhabit ocean environments.

European companies are also making waves in this field. The Dutch firm Blue21 has been developing "Schoonschip," a prototype for floating cities. Meanwhile, Swiss company Oceanix has proposed a modular, sustainable seastead design adaptable to various applications. Their approach highlights the versatility and scalability of seasteading solutions.
These previously mentioned initiatives represent significant progress in seasteading technology and design. While challenges remain, particularly in navigating political and regulatory landscapes, the advancements made by these projects bring the vision of permanent sea-based communities closer to reality.

## The Future

Seasteading faces numerous challenges that hinder its adoption on a global scale. Legal and regulatory issues persist as of 2024 and international maritime law along national sovereignty issues create a complex ecosystem for seasteading to thrive. On the environmental side, potential disruptions to marine ecosystems must be addressed as many countries currently have legal constraints to do with protecting ocean habitats. Moreover, extreme weather conditions will likely become an increasingly troublesome issue if such weather incidents continue to appear around the world. 
There are also open questions which persist around creating self-sufficient, stable structures - such as the ability to withstand harsh ocean conditions while providing the needs of different size populations. In addition, economic viability remains to be seen for a long term community because of high construction costs, maintenance and local sources of food and water which may deter early investors. There are also social and logistical issues such as providing adequate healthcare, creating internal community cohesion on a large scale and at sea.

On the nation state level, there is resistance to larger projects due to the potential increase in the number of tax havens and unregulated territories which may be created. The criticism being that money which would normally be directed to particular governments is no longer accessible by them. This complicated seasteading projects which seek to operate in territorial water and intermediate steps must be taken to assuage this fear.

Yet, seasteading continues to grow in popularity and with the growing number of projects and innovation in this space, it seems inevitable that many of the aforementioned problems will be solved in due time.
