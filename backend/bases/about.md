# The Based Guide

![Guide](/images/articles/about/basedguide.png)

## Welcome to Based.Guide

This website is a guide to the parellel establishment. We collect and write about examples of (network) states that value individual liberty, and we send a newsletter to keep you up to date with the developments of these efforts. Furthermore, we seek to provide resources, essays, and updates on: privacy, free speech, hard money, (scientific progress made possible through) de-regulation, and anything else related to individual sovereignty that interests us.
