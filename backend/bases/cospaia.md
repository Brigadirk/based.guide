# Republic of Cospaia

## What was it?

The Republic of Cospaia was one of the most distinct and long lasting examples of a [stateless society](/projects/glossary#anarcho-capitalism) in history. Originating in central Italy during 1440, it survived until 1826 and owed its creation to a mapmaking error from the negotiations between Florence and the Papal States. Due to this error, the small territory of Cospaia totalling 330 hectares was able to claim its independence. 

Its motto, ‘Perpetua et firma libertas’ (Perpetual and secure freedom), reflected its particular values and status as one of the only successful challenges to the idea that such a nation could not exist peacefully amongst other nationstates. 

While there were many variables which contributed to Cospaia’s anarchic success over three centuries, it was partially due to its ability to cultivate and produce tobacco. Their expertise in this industry was fortuitous due to the tobacco industry exploding in size during the 1500s and there also existing a large and nearby customer base due to the tobacco ban in the Papal States in 1642. This effectively made Cospaia one of the largest suppliers in the area and brought increased numbers of traders and tobacco enthusiasts to their territory.

Politically, Cospaia was governed by a non-coercive group of elders and family leaders which made decisions through economic and social pressures; not direct physical force. In addition to this, Cospaia lacked prisons, formal policing groups and a standing military. Even so, its roughly 600 inhabitants took the principle of self-defense and non-aggression seriously - it was an integral part of their culture and social norms; even without those aforementioned institutions.

Even after Cospaia’s dissolution in 1826 and its integration into the Papal States, its legacy and socio-economic attitudes continued into the 20th century - particularly, its nearly tax free status, and economic vibrancy. Today, Cospaia remains a compelling historical example for those interested in libertarianism, anarchism, the power of free markets and independent micronations.

## History

As mentioned above, The Republic of Cospaia came into existence in 1440 due to a cartographic error during border negotiations between the Republic of Florence and the Papal States. During the 1500s until the 1700s, Cospaia was largely used as a tax free haven for business enterprises and individuals. Merchants frequently traded goods within their borders and smugglers hid and transported contraband items between countries and used Cospaia as an intermediary location.
In the 1500s, tobacco cultivation became a mainstream occupation for Cospaia’s population and this was largely due to its discovery in the Americas and the popularity of it in Europe thereafter. After a brief occupation by French revolutionary forces in 1798, Cospaia once again gained its independence, but this freedom was relatively short-lived. In 1826, the republic was officially split between Tuscany and the Papal States.
Over its history, the republic's population remained relatively small, between 300 to 600 citizens. Even with their small populations and lack of domestic police and armed forces, Cospaia was able to avoid large scale conflicts with neighboring countries and internal conflicts, which would have threatened its existence. Moreover, after its dissolution, its citizens were granted several special privileges, one of them being an exemption from tobacco taxes, as compensation for the loss of their independence.

## Why did it survive for so long?

While we have already talked about several factors which made The Republic of Cospaia successful, there were also structural causes which played a role too. One such example was Cospaia’s small size and as such, its strategic importance was relatively miniscule. In larger geopolitical conflicts which racked the continent during its existence, Cospaia was largely forgotten. This made it an unattractive target for invasions from its neighbors most of the time; preferring to leave Cospaia to its tobacco production which benefited them too. This combination of strategic unimportance, small size and economic usefulness to its neighbors, made Cospaia as successful as it was.

Domestically, Cospaia's resilience seems to have stemmed from its small, but closely integrated community and the involvement of all individuals and their families in the process of governance. This non-rigid and open structure allowed for its adaptability to changing circumstances. Moreover, centralized projects were not needed and therefore, local problems were often identified and solved efficiently by individuals embedded in a community. This cultural and political situation in Cospaia also enabled it to enforce order without creating and maintaining armed forces.

These factors created an intimate balance between Cospaia being valuable enough to be left alone, internally resilient and safe enough to avoid domestic collapse, and dynamic and adaptable enough to chart their own course through almost four centuries of regional changes.

## The End

The Republic of Cospaia's loss of independence in 1826 was not due to internal collapse or failure, but rather the result of evolving external circumstances on the continent. The early 19th century brought significant political shifts in Italy, making it increasingly difficult for a small, independent nation to maintain its anarchic situation amidst growing state consolidation in Europe more generally.

This geopolitical trend towards larger and centralized states likely made Cospaia's independence less tolerable to its neighbors and increased foreign scrutiny on such an entity. Moreover, the economic markets for tobacco spread over the centuries and this likely reduced the leverage Cospaia had and thus weakened its geopolitical position amongst its neighbors.

In addition, Cospaia's small size, lack of adept defense force and diplomatic ties reduced its  ability to resist the external pressures of integration. However, it is worth noting that even after losing political independence, the territory of Cospaia retained many of its defining characteristics.  Thus, Cospaia's failure, if it can be called that, was less something self-inflicted, and more a kind of political absorption.
