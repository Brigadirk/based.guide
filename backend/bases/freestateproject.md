# The Free State Project

What is it?

The Free State Project is a libertarian migration effort founded in 2001 by Jason Sorens and is based in New Hampshire - its target relocation state. In 2016, the goal of reaching 20,000 pledges was reached and this triggered the five year countdown for pledgers to relocate their lives to New Hampshire. As of 2022, 6,232 individuals were recorded as having moved to New Hampshire. The goal was and is, to concentrate the number of persons who value individual freedoms, private property and personal choice, and to work towards reducing the size and scope of state government through democratic civic engagement and the application of libertarian principles. Sorens’ theory proposed that if 20,000 libertarian minded persons moved to a state with a small enough population, it would be possible to influence its policy, and make the culture more free and open.

History

The idea for the Free State project originated from Sorens’ 2001 essay in the publication, The Libertarian Enterprise, entitled ‘Announcement: The Free State Project’. Sorens lamented the failure of the national libertarian movement to make progress and outlined the need for a new type of libertarian movement focused on the local and state level. After the release of his article and a call to pledge, the first 5000 pledgers voted in 2002 for New Hampshire to be the destination state. At the time, current New Hampshire governor, Craig Benson, supported the free state project and lobbied them to select New Hampshire.

Why New Hampshire?

Historically, New Hampshire has always been a state which has leaned towards greater individual freedom and liberty. It was the first state to declare its independence and the first state to adopt its own constitution. Its official motto, ‘Live Free or Die’ is a rallying cry for those who value the ideas of private property, individual freedoms and personal liberty. More than this, New Hampshire has no general state sales tax, no general state income tax and no mandatory seatbelt laws for adults.

On the political level, New Hampshire is one of the most decentralized and politically accessible states in the U.S. In practice, two thirds of the tax burden is decided on the local, not state level. Most of the state's revenue is generated from local property tax and this goes towards supporting schools, roads, police and fire departments. The state itself only gives a small amount of financial help to local governments.

Local governments have the ability to decide what and how they are going to budget. This means local governments can decide how much they are going to raise in taxes and this makes the entire process more accessible to the average citizen. What makes New Hampshire even more unique, is that most towns still have the New England style meeting system of government and this allows direct voting on budgets - each line of the budget requiring a separate vote. This all amounts to citizens being able to vote for more fiscally responsible budgets which lower taxes if they so choose. This is why New Hampshire is and has been, a perfect place for people who value limited government and individual freedoms.

The Progress

The main goals of the Free State Project are to create a society aligned with libertarian principles by reducing the power of state government, minimizing taxes and regulations, strengthening civil liberties, decentralizing authority to local levels, and advancing libertarian political representation through elected offices. New Hampshire is envisioned as the future flagship of the libertarian movement.

As of 2024, the Free State Project has made political, legal and economic progress in the following ways: marijuana decriminalization, constitutional carry for firearms, election of over 45 candidates as legislators, expanded the castle doctrine, repealed knife laws, reduced the state budget by 11%, prevented income tax and the bump stock ban, strengthened existing homeschooling freedoms and deregulated cryptocurrency. This is only a portion of the progress the Free State Project has made in New Hampshire since its inception.

Even with this progress, FSP has not yet been able to reduce the overall scope of New Hampshire’s state government functions and internal bureaucracy.

The Future

Current efforts include electing more libertarian-minded candidates to state/local offices, pushing for further deregulation across the board, advocating more school choice initiatives, enacting local control over state authority, further tax reductions on businesses, decriminalizing other drug offenses beyond marijuana, and building libertarian community hubs and businesses within New Hampshire. 

Wanting to move to New Hampshire and join the Free State Project? 

In order to do so, you must select in the affirmative that, ‘I hereby state my solemn intent to move to the State of New Hampshire. Once there, I will exert the fullest practical effort toward the creation of a society in which the maximum role of civil government is the protection of individuals' life, liberty, and property.’
