# Luna - The Moon is a Harsh Mistress

## What is it?

In Robert A. Heinlein's 1966 novel, ‘The Moon is a Harsh Mistress’, Luna is a lunar penal colony located on a fictional version of Earth's moon in 2075. This setting serves as a backdrop for Heinlein’s exploration of both economic and political ideas about freedom and self-determination. By the time the story takes place, Luna has grown into a highly diverse society populated by convicts and their descendents. Both groups together are known as ‘Loonies’. 
 
On Luna, the majority of inhabitants live and work underground to protect themselves from the inhospitable surface conditions of the moon. The structure of Luna itself is a network of communities connected by a vast system of tunnels and underground dwellings. In addition, a large portion of Luna's wealth comes from its grain production which it exports to Earth. By using hydroponic farming technologies, Luna supplies food to an overpopulated Earth and this becomes one of the major sources of conflict in the story. Specifically, Luna can no longer support the existing export deal it has with Earth due to its own dwindling supplies and lack of adequate compensation from Earth for the grain.

On the political side, the society of Luna is characterized by a loosely structured set of groups, initially governed by the Lunar Authority. The Loonies have developed their own set of cultural customs and social norms which include linguistic knowledge, polyamorous family structures due to a 2:1 female to male gender ratio, and a strong emphasis on self-reliance, individual freedom and fairness. In the context of the story, the culture and way of life has evolved due to the constant threat of death from small errors, technological mishaps and the fear of social chaos. This setting and its unique near future situation provides an interesting backdrop to explore the ideas of liberty, revolution, and the general challenges of building a new society.

## Fictional History

The full evolution of Luna over the course of ‘The Moon is a Harsh Mistress’, spans from its original purpose as a penal colony, to its eventual revolution and independence from Earth and the Luna Authority. This evolution largely takes place as a result of Luna developing its own cultural and political systems beyond the initial intent of its penal colony design. It became home to a vast number of inmates and their descendants and slowly became its own functioning society, complete with its own economic and political demands, independent from Earths.

The time span over which events take place is between 2075 and 2076, and Luna is still a penal colony with a population of three million people. However, in the beginning of the story it is still under the control of the Lunar Authority which was established to govern Luna’s population and exploit its resources for Earth. The main characters include Manuel O’Kelly-Davis, a computer technician who becomes the leader of the revolution, Wyoming Knott, a political activist and organizer, Professor Bernardo de la Paz, who is the intellectual foundation to the revolution and calls himself a ‘rational anarchist’.

These characters along with others spearhead the transformation from a controlled and coerced lunar colony, to an independent and libertarian inspired society on the moon. The grain export issue becomes the spark which kickstarts the revolution and the direct challenge to Earth’s authority over it. Over the course of events, Luna evolves into a sovereign society for its people. It is not only an interesting exploration of libertarian ideas, but an exploration of how communities and cultures can develop their own identities and aspirations over time and the acceleration of this divergence via large distances and differing environments.

## How could it be more free?

While the principles, aims and achievements of the Luna revolution come close to a full blooded type of libertarianism, there are several aspects which could have been explored further and several story elements that could have been implemented more coherently to make Luna freer. For example, after eliminating the Lunar Authority, Heinlein could have discussed how private security forces could have been organized and created from the remnants of the revolutionary militias. It could have been possible for these private security firms to find work protecting businesses and mining operations from potential further threats from Earth and the potential danger of a restless fighting force with no revolution left to wage.

Another aspect which is left relatively unexplored is the type of legal systems and contractual relationships Luna’s people use. Legally, it would be possible for Luna to adopt a polycentric legal structure where multiple private court systems exist and where individuals can voluntarily choose which system to use for dispute resolution. This would effectively create a market for justice and encourage innovation in legal practices. Moreover, Luna and its people heavily rely on informal types of agreements to enforce individual and business property rights. However, by making such agreements more formal and explicit, it would help to protect individuals and reduce the errors in negotiations and disagreements between different parties. This could also extend beyond business and into areas like marriage, community memberships and even citizenship for people wanting to immigrate to Luna.

In addition, Luna uses the Hong Kong dollar as currency, but it could use a broad range of currencies and banking systems to allow for greater competition in financial markets. This could be in the form of multiple competing digital currencies like cryptocurrency or by allowing multiple nation states to do trade and exchange money for goods and services. For instance, the creation of multiple private banks could allow for different currencies to be issued and compete with one another. Lastly, different financial services could be offered by each bank, effectively giving more choices to customers and dismantling any form of unfair monopoly or centralisation.

Although there are other changes which could be made, implementing the suggestions above would push Luna towards an even more radically libertarian society, maximizing individual freedom and minimizing coercion. However, like all progress, they would also introduce new problems to Luna, but hopefully better ones which would make it easier to maintain social order and cooperation between the Loonies going forward.

## Could this work today?

While a lunar colony like Luna would be possible in principle today, it would likely require a number of technological scaling advances, greater political cooperation between nation states and private companies and vast amounts of wealth to be continually spent on its creation and maintenance over decades.

One of the areas where further innovation needs to occur, is the price of space travel itself. While companies like SpaceX today have drastically reduced the cost of launching rockets into space, the cost of constructing rockets would need to be reduced even further. This is because sustaining and creating a lunar colony would require a steady stream of supplies to sustain it’s infrastructure and three million inhabitants.

Another problem would be having large and self-sustainable living habitats for the large population of the lunar colony. Life support systems have been tried and tested on smaller scales already in projects like the international space station, but this is trivial compared to the monumental task of keeping entire colonies alive on the moon. To do so, such life support systems would need to be capable of recycling air, water and waste on a huge scale. Moreover, any life support systems and other types of technology would require stable and reliable energy sources. This would have to include things like solar panels or nuclear reactors which could be maintained by specialist technicians on the moon itself.

However, there are some areas in which progress has been made and could be adopted more easily to realize a lunar colony like Luna. The implementation of private property would have to be enforced, recognising private lunar land ownership of individuals and companies. This would initially need to be agreed upon by a collection of nation states, but also any companies which got involved too. For example, a  joint agreement and process by which lunar land is claimed and agreed upon would have to be established in some form prior to colonization to avoid potential conflict.

In the initial stages of the development, it would also be necessary for decentralized communication between Earth and the moon to be established and maintained. This is so that sending and receiving reliable information about the state of shipping supplies, lunar projects and other vital situations could be achieved. While this technology is available today,  long distance communications increase the risk of errors and transmission times.

While it’s impossible to predict the future, perhaps one way colonization would start in earnest would be through  a small group of wealthy nation states, private companies and individuals who group together with a shared goal to fund the initial lunar infrastructure. As the lunar colony grows, it would likely attract more investment and labor from Earth’s population. Many of whom would be interested in being part of such a monumental project and seeking to explore new frontiers.

Although not a libertarian ideal, nation states would likely be required to play a relatively large role in the beginning across many types of industries. As the lunar colony would be owned by no single entity, it would also likely need its own currency and some type of completely digital payment system like cryptocurrency.

Depending on the scale of nation state involvement in the beginning, a Luna like colony would have to eventually uncouple itself from Earth based governments to form its own political system and gain full autonomy. The difficulty of doing such a thing would depend on how dependent the colony was on trade with Earth to survive. It would need to produce its own food and water, communication systems and manufacturing industries to truly be independent and not subject to the whims of governments from Earth.

While technically feasible, and an optimistic vision for the future, such a society remains a relatively distant possibility. We have yet to return to the moon in decades and Earth has yet to land a single human astronaut so in general, far more human ingenuity and resources need to be spent on getting more people and infrastructure into space. Technically, there is no specific breakthrough which is required, but scaling current technologies to the size needed for such a colony has yet to be done or seriously thought about at the detail required.
